    "Binary files, such as image files, are usually very long files that are not humanly readable and, hence, need to be interpreted by a program (e.g., an image viewing application).\n",

    "If your analysis does not require the information from merges, you can disable their mining by setting `extract_merges=False` in `mine_git_repo()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, merged versions differ only in a few lines and are otherwise identical.\n",
    "However, as mentioned above, only one version is kept during a merge, and git records the second version as deleted.\n",
    "This behaviour is problematic for two reasons:\n",
    "First, merge commits result in large amounts of lines that git considers as deleted even though the identical line from the second version continues to exist.\n",
